As part of his job as a hardware architect at Matrox Graphics, he studied and developed various vertex and pixel shader technologies. He is currently employed at Digital Fiction where he develops games for various next generation consoles. </font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Steffen Bendel<br> </b>Steffen started his career as a game programmer in 1996, when he worked one year for a company called BlueByte. After that, he studied physics with specialism in quantum optics at the university in Rostock. While studying he worked as a freelancer for Massive Development, where he wrote some parts of the 3D-engine of the underwater game Aquanox.<b><br> </b></font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Chris Brennan<br> </b>Chris graduated with a BS in Computer Science and another BS in Electrical Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in '97 and joined Digital Equipment Corp's Workstation Graphics group doing hardware design and verification. When Digital died, Chris joined ATI as a 3D ASIC designer for the Radeon line of graphics chips and then moved over to their 3D Application Research Group where he tries to get those chips to do things that were not originally thought possible. </font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Dean Calver<br> </b>Games are fun; I figured that out at age 2 and have spent the following years working out how to make better games. For the last 5 years people have even paid me to do it. Having no real preference for console or PC has meant a mixed career flipping between them for every project. Professionally I started on a war game, I then did 3 years of racing game followed by an X-COM style game, then arcade classic updates, currently doing a 3D graphic adventure.<br> I still study various subject including optics, mathematics and other geeky things for fun. This incredibly stupid preoccupation with learning means that I have been doing exams every year for over half my life (which is really stupid given I work full time). At least I'll be ready for to write the first game for a quantum computer.<b><br> </b></font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Drew Card<br> </b>Drew Card is currently a software engineer in the 3D Application Research Group at ATI Research where he is focusing on the application of shader based rendering techniques.
